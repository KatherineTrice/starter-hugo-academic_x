Katherine Trice is a PhD student in Northeastern University's Psychology Department. Her research interests focus on the cognitive and neural mechanisms underpinning language learning, particularly in autistic individuals. She leads the MIND projects, which probe the mechanims modulating vocablary aquisittion in neurotypical and autistic indivdiuals, and the LESSO project, which teases apart the cognitive factors supporting sign language aquisition. Katherine is currently extensive neuroimaging experince in both MRI and EEG settings, and has worked with a wide varity of populations, including autistic and neurotypical children and adults and Deaf adults.
